#summary BonusPack Tutorial #3: Marker Clustering.

(we assume you already followed [Tutorial_1] and [Tutorial_2])

= 10. Marker Clustering =

Marker Clustering is a now classical technique when you have a lot of markers on a map, to group markers which are close together in a single "cluster" marker, displaying the number of markers it "contains". 

This (cool) feature is available in OSMBonusPack with the RadiusMarkerClusterer. 

If you already grouped your markers in a FolderOverlay (as we did in chapter 5 with poiMarkers), introducing marker clustering is trivial. 
You replace the FolderOverlay by a RadiusMarkerClusterer: 
{{{
RadiusMarkerClusterer poiMarkers = new RadiusMarkerClusterer(this);
}}}

You also have to set an icon for the clusters. This is the icon to be used when there are many markers in a cluster. 
As this icon must be a Bitmap, here is the usual way to get a Bitmap from a Drawable resource: 
{{{
Drawable clusterIconD = getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.marker_cluster);
Bitmap clusterIcon = ((BitmapDrawable)clusterIconD).getBitmap();
}}}

Then you can set this icon to clusters:
{{{
poiMarkers.setIcon(clusterIcon);
}}}

The rest of the code: adding the poiMarkers to map overlays, and adding markers to poiMarkers, has already been done in chapter 5, and need no change. 

So you can give it a try. 

The result when searching for "bakery" with NominatimPOIProvider:

If you zoom in, each individual marker appears. When you zoom out, they are grouped and displayed with the cluster icon. Fine, isn't it?

= 11. Customizing the clusters design - and beyond =

== 11.1 Simple customization ==
To customize the design of clusters, the first level is to use the available getters, setters and public attributes. 

Example:
{{{
poiMarkers.getTextPaint().setColor(Color.DKGRAY);
poiMarkers.getTextPaint().setTextSize(12.0f);
poiMarkers.mAnchorU = Marker.ANCHOR_RIGHT;
poiMarkers.mAnchorV = Marker.ANCHOR_BOTTOM;
poiMarkers.mTextAnchorV = 0.40f;
}}}

== 11.2 Advanced customization ==
But you may want to go deeper. There is a lot of excellent ideas for cluster design: 
 * circles with various colors or sizes, 
 * set of photos,
 * ... 

You can implement such designs by sub-classing the RadiusMarkerClusterer. 
Then you override #buildClusterMarker(StaticCluster cluster, MapView mapView) method, and you draw your cluster icon as needed. 

To have a good starting point, you can look 
 * at RadiusMarkerClusterer#buildClusterMarker source code
 * or at OSMBonusPackTuto CirclesGridMarkerClusterer, which implements circles with various colors and sizes. 

If you want to go further, you can also implement your own clustering algorithm. You "just" have to sub-class the MarkerClusterer, and override the #clusterer(MapView mapView) method.
